# Bootcamp practice: JavaScript.

## Instructions

### Iteration 1: Names and Input

  1.1 Create a variable `hacker1` with the driver's name. <br>
  1.2 Print `"The driver's name is XXXX"`.<br>
  1.3 Create a variable `hacker2` with the navigator's name.<br>
  1.4 Print `"The navigator's name is YYYY"`.

### Iteration 2: Conditionals
  2.1. Depending on which name [is longer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length), print:
  <br>
	  - `The driver has the longest name, it has XX characters.` or <br>
	  - `It seems that the navigator has the longest name, it has XX characters.` or <br>
	  - `Wow, you both have equally long names, XX characters!`.

### Iteration 3: Loops
  3.1 Print all the characters of the driver's name, separated by a space and [in capitals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toUpperCase)
  i.e. `"J O H N"`
  
  3.2 Print all the characters of the navigator's name, in reverse order. 
  i.e. `"nhoJ"`
  
  3.3 Depending on the [lexicographic order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order) of the strings, print: <br>
    - `The driver's name goes first.` <br>
    - `Yo, the navigator goes first definitely.` <br>
    - `What?! You both have the same name?`

### Bonus Time!

#### Bonus 1:
Go to [lorem ipsum generator](http://www.lipsum.com/) and:
  - Generate 3 paragraphs. Store the text in a variable type of string.
  - Make your program count the number of words in the string.
  - Make your program count the number of times the Latin word [`et`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/et#Latin) appears.

#### Bonus 2:
Create a new variable `phraseToCheck` and have it contain some string value. Write a code that will check if the value we assigned to this variable is a [Palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome). Here are some examples of palindromes: 
  - "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
  - "Amor, Roma"
  - "race car"
  - "stack cats"
  - "step on no pets"
  - "taco cat"
  - "put it up"
  - "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" and "No 'x' in Nixon".
